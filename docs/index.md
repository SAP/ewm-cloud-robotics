# Description
Human-safe collaborative robots ("Cobots") are widely available from hundreds of low-cost vendors, leading to heterogenous fleets of cobots that need to easily integrate with corresponding management systems. **ewm-cloud-robotics** represents such an integration, leveraging the core of Cloud Robotics in two flavors:
- Kyma/Istio ([repo](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-robotics), [doc](https://sap.github.io/cloud-robotics/))
- Google ([repo](https://github.com/googlecloudrobotics/core), [doc](https://googlecloudrobotics.github.io/core/))

Both flavors are able to package and distribute applications for autonomous fulfilment of warehouse orders & tasks commissioned by [SAP EWM (Extended Warehouse Management](https://www.sap.com/germany/products/extended-warehouse-management.html)) just like in the video below.
