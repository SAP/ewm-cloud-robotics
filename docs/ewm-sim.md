# ewm-sim (v2)
This project is inspired by the [mockserver-server](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz/mockserver-server) by [Arnaud Buchholz](https://github.com/ArnaudBuchholz).
It makes use of the SAPUI5 MockServer and runs it in a standalone mode to mock the real odata service of an EWM system. By this, we now achieved a much slimmer approach compared to the former version of ewm-sim.

## Getting Started
Note that the mockserver will not start, if the environment variables ODATA_USER and ODATA_PASSWD have not been set and optionally you can set the interval for the generation of warehouse orders with GEN_INT in milliseconds :warning:

### Local
To get the project up and running, issue the following commands in the root directory of the project (docker/ewm-sim):
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

### Docker :whale:
Start your docker daemon and run: 
```sh
$ docker pull ghcr.io/sap/ewm-cloud-robotics/ewm-sim:latest
```
Now we need to set our environment variables, forward traffic to the host's port and run our docker image.
```sh
$ docker run -e ODATA_USER=root -e ODATA_PASSWD=123 -e GEN_INT=30000 -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/sap/ewm-cloud-robotics/ewm-sim:latest
```
(Surely the first occurrence of 8080 can be replaced with any desired and free port of the host. **DO NOT** specify $ODATA_PORT when running in docker mode.)

**OR**

Make sure you're in the correct directory (docker/ewm-sim) and run:
```sh
$ docker build --tag ewm-sim:1.0 .
$ docker run -e ODATA_USER=root -e ODATA_PASSWD=123 -p 8080:8080 ewm-sim:1.0
```

## Making Requests

[Here](https://github.com/SAP/ewm-cloud-robotics/docker/ewm-sim/ZEWM_ROBCO_SRV.postman_collection.json) you can find a postman collection with example requests.

Maybe it's also helpful to have a look on our [unit tests](https://github.com/SAP/ewm-cloud-robotics/blob/master/docker/ewm-sim/test/test.js), to get a deeper understanding of the workflow.

## Postman Collection
Included in the project folder is a [Postman Collection](../docker/ewm-sim/ZEWM_ROBCO_SRV.postman_collection.json). It enables you to send a few test requests to the server.

To use it:
* prepare the environment
    1. open Postman
    1. click on "Manage Environments" (top right corner)
    1. Import > Choose Files
    1. select the postman environment file
    1. click on the name of the collection
    1. enter the credentials you started the server with in the "current value" fields
    1. "Update" and close configuration window
    1. change "No Environment" to "OData Credentials" (top right corner)
* import the collection
    1. open Postman
    1. click on "Import" (top left corner)
    1. File > Upload Files
    1. select the postman collection file

## Current State of Implementation
Currently, the basic mockserver is up and running. It is served by an express web service.
This includes:
* initializing the server from the provided mockdata .json files
* serving the data as an odata service
* providing **basic** odata functionality out of the box like
    * GET,
    * PUSH,
    * PUT,
    * DELETE
  requests

### Function Imports
Additionally we are currently working to get the special functionality provided by the oData service of a real EWM system.
Current status of those function imports is:
* **fully mocked**
    * AssignRobotToWarehouseOrder
    * ConfirmWarehouseTask
    * ConfirmWarehouseTaskFirstStep
    * GetInProcessWarehouseOrders¹
    * GetNewRobotTypeWarehouseOrders¹
    * GetNewRobotWarehouseOrder
    * GetRobotWarehouseOrders
    * SendFirstConfirmationError
    * SendSecondConfirmationError
    * SetRobotStatus
    * UnassignRobotFromWarehouseOrder
    * UnsetWarehouseOrderInProcessStatus
* **WIP**
    * --
* **not implemented yet**
    * --

¹ Due to missing properties in the oData model, implementation is only for demo purpose. The returned **values will differ** from an actual EWM system. The resource type is hardcoded to RB01, the resource group to RB02.

## Additional Notes
* Special error cases of EWM Systems tend not to occur in a mocked environment. Among them but not limited to:
    * INTERNAL_ERROR
    * WAREHOUSE_ORDER_LOCKED
    * WAREHOUSE_ORDER_NOT_UNASSIGNED
    * WAREHOUSE_TASK_ASSIGNED (property missing in oData Entity OpenWarehouseTaskSet)

* When running the project, additional configuration options can be applied via environment variables:
   * ODATA_PORT - port for the exposed http server; **only** use this if running via npm (default: 8080)
   * LOGGING_LOGTOFILE - redirect console log to files (default: false)
