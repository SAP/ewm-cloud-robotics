# ðŸ¤– ewm-cloud-robotics ðŸ¤–  - [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/SAP/ewm-cloud-robotics.svg?token=UgRpWYHRU3yqYszd3B6x&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/SAP/ewm-cloud-robotics)

## Description
Human-safe collaborative robots ("Cobots") are widely available from hundreds of low-cost vendors, leading to heterogenous fleets of cobots that need to easily integrate with corresponding management systems. **ewm-cloud-robotics** represents such an integration, leveraging the core of Google Cloud Robotics ([repo](https://github.com/googlecloudrobotics/core), [doc](https://googlecloudrobotics.github.io/core/)) to package and distribute applications for autonomous fulfilment of warehouse orders & tasks commissioned by [SAP EWM (Extended Warehouse Management](https://www.sap.com/germany/products/extended-warehouse-management.html)) just like in the video below.
